3. what is generalized and specilized class in java

ans: Generalization is the process of common features from two or more classes, and combining them into a generalized super class. Common features can be methods, attributes and associations. In other word, we can say that a super class is a generalization of its subclass.

specialization is defined as the process of subclassing a superclass entity on the basis of some distinguishing characteristic of the entity in the superclass. The reason for creating such hierarchical relationship is that:

4. a)i don't want my calss to be inherited by any other calss what shoud i do

      ans: make calss final
	  
   b)can you give a few examples of final calss defiend in java API
     ans: String,java.lang.math; 

   c). what are some alternatives to inhertance?
     ans:   Delegation can be an alternative to inheritance. Delegation means that you use an object of another class as an instance variable, and forward messages to the instance.

5. which sorted collection have you used 

  ans:java.util.Collections
  
  
  
  
6. what is the diffrence between linkedList And arrayList


ans : 
          --> linkedList 
    *his class uses a doubly linked list to store the elements in it. Similar to the ArrayList, this class also supports the storage of all types of objects.

	*This class implements both the List interface and the Deque interface. Therefore, it can act as a list and a deque.

	*This class works better when the application demands manipulation of the stored data.
	
	  --->ArrayList
	
	*This class uses a dynamic array to store the elements in it. With the introduction of generics, this class supports the storage of all types of objects.
	
	*This class implements a List interface. Therefore, this acts as a list.
	
	*This class works better when the application demands storing the data and accessing it.
	
7. what is listIterator and Iterator in java?	

   -->Iterator
   
   *Can traverse elements present in Collection only in the forward direction.
   *Helps to traverse Map, List and Set.
   *Indexes cannot be obtained by using Iterator.
   *Certain methods of Iterator are next(), remove() and hasNext().
   
   
   -->ListIteraror
   
   *Can traverse elements present in Collection both in forward and backward directions.
   *Can only traverse List and not the other two.
   *It has methods like nextIndex() and previousIndex() to obtain indexes of elements at any time while traversing List.
   *Certain methods of ListIterator are next(), previous(), hasNext(), hasPrevious(), add(E e).
   
   
 8. what is the covariant method overrding in java

ans: Covariant Method overriding means that when overriding a method in the child class, the  return type may vary. Before java 5 it was not allowed to override any function if the return type is changed in the child class. But now it is possible only return type is subtype class.


9 .what is memory leakage in java
ans: In Java, the memory leak is a situation when the garbage collector does not recognize the unused objects and they remain in the memory indefinitely that reduces the amount of memory allocated to the application.

10 . exaplin static polymorpisum and dynamic polymorpisum?

ans: static polymorpisum: in calss multiple number methos has same name but deffrience in parameter
     is static polymorpisum.
	 
	  dynamic polymorpisum:same method name and maethod signature but diffrence in calss through child calss
	  
	  
11 . calss Hema{

		private String name;
		private int age;
		private String address;
		private String education;

   }
 ans:  by Encpsulation making data has private Hema make her data Private.
